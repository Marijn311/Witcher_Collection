## 📝 Chapter Summaries

If you want a very quick refresher on what has happened so far while reading, you can consult the summaries in **section 3**.
Each chapter is summarized in roughly three sentences, focusing on the main events.

## 👤 Character Portraits (Spoiler-Free)

When I read books, I often find it difficult to keep track of who is who, especially in large fantasy worlds such as that of *The Witcher*. This is partly because I struggle to form a clear mental image of each character’s appearance.

To address this, **section 4** contains spoiler-free portraits of the main characters. These portraits are as faithful as possible to the book descriptions and are **not** based on the games or the Netflix series.

## 🎨 Chapter Illustrations

I find it a shame that adult books rarely include illustrations. There is a lot of excellent fan art that stays true to the books and is enjoyable to view while reading.

After finishing a chapter, I like to treat myself to illustrations depicting the events I have just read about. Searching for this kind of content online takes effort and often exposes you to spoilers.

That is why I am creating **section 5**, which contains book-accurate illustrations of the events of each chapter. The goal is to let you experience *The Witcher* books as if they were fully illustrated.

I started by collecting and ordering all of **Denis Gordeev’s** illustrations, the classic black-and-white ones, and I plan to add many more from a wide range of sources.

This is a lot of work and will remain a work in progress, probably forever.
