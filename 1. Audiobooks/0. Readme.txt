All audio books are available on YouTube in a playlist by "Audiobooks By AS"

You can listen to them on YouTube or you can download them as mp3 files.
To download the audio books as mp3 files from YouTube I suggest using https://en.ytgoconverter.com
as this converter has no limit for video length. If you are not using any ad-blockers you will get ads/spam pop-ups when you click the download link. Just accept this and close the popups because this is how the converter can make some money stay online. After trying 2 or 3 times with pop-ups it will actually start the conversion/download. 

Be aware that high quality audiobooks can take up to 1GB per book.
My untrained ear doesn't hear a difference between 320 kbps and 64 kbps quality, and it is not music anyways so I recommend downloading the smallest file.

Pro-tip: You can put local files on Spotify if you want your audiobook in Spotify. You can do this on PC and mobile.

I have all the mp3 files downloaded locally. In case the audiobooks are every removed from youtube, please send we a message and I can send them to you.
